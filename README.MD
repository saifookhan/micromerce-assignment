### Feedback

- Overall assignment was not so diffcult.
- What was a bit challenging was to properly configure webpack from the scratch.
- I tried to showcase different use-cases of Webpack eg.
  - logo.svg is loaded as a raw asset
  - while the other two images are loaded by the Webpack.
  - Copy plugin was used to copy the raw assets to `dist` folder.
  - sass-loader was used load the .sass files.
- Images were resized in Photoshop for faster loading.
  Decreasing their size to ~500KBs vs 20MB original.
- Bootstrap was used for layout and grid.
- Pug templating is used as instructed.

Thank you!

Looking forward hearing from you.
